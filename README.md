# EC-DFR
EC-DFR is an enhanced cascade based deep forest regressor for drug synergy prediction. 

# Code
EC-DFR can be run via the function "mp_kfold(x,y,n_spilt,n_repeat,random_state,n_jobs)" defined in "Multiprocess_KFold.py". Other python files are used to construct EC-DFR, which shouldn't be run directly.
For the output of EC-EFR, there are 2 examples in the folder named "results_demo". 

# Data
The dataset and the corresponding function to load it are in the folder name "data0825".
